                   <p class="about-text">
                     Kathy Conroy is an artist who has been fascinated by
                     capturing the essence of wildlife for as long as she can
                     remember. Taking paints to canvas ever since she was a
                     young child, sheâ€™s been mastering her craft for well over
                     50 years. Though she is largely self taught in a wide
                     variety of mediums, she holds a degree in Graphic Arts from
                     the Art Institute of Cincinnati, where she was first
                     introduced to scratchboard.</p>
                     <p class="about-text">
                     She immediately fell in love with the meticulous detail and
                     play with textures that it entailed, finding it the perfect
                     way to express her passion for animals. She has been
                     refining her scratchboard skills for nearly 20 years,
                     studying under numerous master scratchboard artists from
                     around the world.
                     She is a juried member of the International Society of
                     Scratchboard Artists, Kentucky Crafted, Kentucky Guild of
                     Artists and Craftsmen and the Henry County Art Guild. She
                     frequently performs live demonstrations at shows across
                     Kentucky, where she has received close to ten first place
                     awards for her artwork.<p class="about-text">
                     Kathy has also appeared as a featured artist in numerous
                     print publications and media outlets including the Kentucky
                     Life Series on the KET Network, Kentucky Arts Council,
                     Kentucky Homes and Gardens magazine, and many more. Her
                     work can always be found on her website
                     (artbykathyconroy.com) and by visiting The Kentucky Artisan
                     Center, Damselfly Gallery and Wild Birds Unlimited.</p>
                     <p class="about-text">
                     Kathy currently lives in Pleasureville, Kentucky where she
                     can be found in her studio, happily creating commissioned
                     pieces and other works for her next art show.
